# Photo Sharing Web APP
- Deployed on Heroku Cloud: https://fathomless-dusk-39889.herokuapp.com
- Developed front-end with JavaScript & Bootstrap and built back-end with Node.js & Express.js: show, add, delete and edit photos coupled with comments.
- Plugged in Passport.js to ensure correct authorization: users are empowered with creation operation only after login and are permitted to edit and delete their own photos and comments.
- Integrated Google Map API & geocode.js to show imaging location.
- Utilized Ajax to realize responsive fuzzy search for photos.
- Implemented the feature of image upload with multer and cloudinary.
- Maintained a serve-side MongoDB database to ensure consistency.
